# Sales Forecasting Model with Excel & Power BI
## Empowering Decision-Making: A Data-Driven Approach to Sales Forecasting


## Overview
This project leverages data integration, analysis, and visualization to build a dynamic sales forecasting model. By combining internal sales data with external trends, we aim to optimize resource allocation and empower decision-making for sales teams.

## Theme
- Integration of economic, market, and operational data.
- Dynamic dashboards for real-time performance tracking.
- Predictive insights to guide strategic sales efforts.

### Key Objectives
Build an accurate sales forecasting model.
Identify sales trends and patterns across products, regions, and time periods.
Create dynamic and interactive dashboards in Power BI.
Enhance decision-making with data-driven insights.

### The Problem:
Sales teams face challenges in allocating resources efficiently across regions and products.
Inefficiencies arise from reliance on intuition rather than data-driven insights.

### Our Solution:
A robust sales forecasting model using Excel and Power BI.
Integration of economic, operational, and market trend data for accurate predictions.
Visual dashboards to guide strategic decisions in real-time.

### Key Features:
- Real-time, interactive dashboards for performance monitoring.
- Insights into high-growth opportunities and resource optimization.
- Scalable design for different industries and datasets.

### Impact:
- Optimized resource allocation.
- Improved sales team performance through focused efforts.
- Increased profitability through data-driven strategies.

### Methodology:
- Data Integration: Merging sales data with additional datasets to uncover hidden patterns.
- Analysis: Insights into profitability, seasonality, and marketing impact.
- Forecasting: Predictive modeling for sales trends across regions, products, and timeframes.

### Project Steps
- Data Cleaning and Preparation (Completed)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales Forecasting Model Development
- Visualization and Dashboard Creation
- Documentation and Finalization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, yearly).
Identify seasonal patterns and peaks.
Explore relationships between sales and external factors (e.g., marketing spend, regional performance)

** Aggregating sales by cost/quantity by months/years.
```
# Convert MONTHS to numerical format for ordering
month_order = {
    "January": 1, "February": 2, "March": 3, "April": 4, "May": 5, "June": 6,
    "July": 7, "August": 8, "September": 9, "October": 10, "November": 11, "December": 12
}
sales_data["MONTH_NUM"] = sales_data["MONTHS"].map(month_order)

# Aggregate sales data by year and month
sales_trend = sales_data.groupby(["YEARS", "MONTH_NUM"]).agg({"COST": "sum"}).reset_index()

# Sort data chronologically
sales_trend = sales_trend.sort_values(by=["YEARS", "MONTH_NUM"])
```

<!-- Insights Extraction:
Highlight key findings (e.g., regions with the highest growth, product category performance).
Identify outliers or anomalies in sales data.


<!---Storytelling Framework
Start with the "Why" (Purpose):

Highlight the importance of forecasting for resource optimization and decision-making.
Show the problem/opportunity (e.g., missed sales targets or inefficient allocations).
Present Key Insights:

Use the sales trends to showcase growth, seasonality, and areas of potential improvement.
Highlight external factors (e.g., inflation, competitor sales) influencing performance.
Show the Forecasting Impact:

Compare historical performance to the model's predictions.
Emphasize how the model can preempt challenges (e.g., inventory shortages) and optimize resources.
Interactive Dashboards for Decision-Making:

Create dynamic Power BI visuals that allow stakeholders to drill down into specific regions, products, or timelines.
Conclude with Value:

Summarize ROI and actionable recommendations.
